Build plugins
Create, test, and distribute plugins for Codex

This page is for plugin authors. If you want to browse, install, and use plugins in Codex, see Plugins. If you are still iterating on one repo or one personal workflow, start with a local skill. Build a plugin when you want to share that workflow across teams, bundle app integrations or MCP config, or publish a stable package.

Create a plugin with $plugin-creator

For the fastest setup, use the built-in $plugin-creator skill.

plugin-creator skill in Codex
It scaffolds the required .codex-plugin/plugin.json manifest and can also generate a local marketplace entry for testing. If you already have a plugin folder, you can still use $plugin-creator to wire it into a local marketplace.

Build your own curated plugin list

A marketplace is a JSON catalog of plugins. $plugin-creator can generate one for a single plugin, and you can keep adding entries to that same marketplace to build your own curated list for a repo, team, or personal workflow.

In Codex, each marketplace appears as a selectable source in the plugin directory. Use $REPO_ROOT/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json for a repo-scoped list or ~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json for a personal list. Add one entry per plugin under plugins[], point each source.path at the plugin folder with a ./-prefixed path relative to the marketplace root, and set interface.displayName to the label you want Codex to show in the marketplace picker. Then restart Codex. After that, open the plugin directory, choose your marketplace, and browse or install the plugins in that curated list.

You don’t need a separate marketplace per plugin. One marketplace can expose a single plugin while you are testing, then grow into a larger curated catalog as you add more plugins.

Create a plugin manually

Start with a minimal plugin that packages one skill.

Create a plugin folder with a manifest at .codex-plugin/plugin.json.
mkdir -p my-first-plugin/.codex-plugin

my-first-plugin/.codex-plugin/plugin.json

{
  "name": "my-first-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Reusable greeting workflow",
  "skills": "./skills/"
}

Use a stable plugin name in kebab-case. Codex uses it as the plugin identifier and component namespace.

Add a skill under skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md.
mkdir -p my-first-plugin/skills/hello

my-first-plugin/skills/hello/SKILL.md

---
name: hello
description: Greet the user with a friendly message.
---

Greet the user warmly and ask how you can help.

Add the plugin to a marketplace. Use $plugin-creator to generate one, or follow Build your own curated plugin list to wire the plugin into Codex manually.
From there, you can add MCP config, app integrations, or marketplace metadata as needed.

Install a local plugin manually

Use a repo marketplace or a personal marketplace, depending on who should be able to access the plugin or curated list.

Choose an option

Repo

Personal
Add a marketplace file at $REPO_ROOT/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json and store your plugins under $REPO_ROOT/plugins/.

Repo marketplace example

Step 1: Copy the plugin folder into $REPO_ROOT/plugins/my-plugin.

mkdir -p ./plugins
cp -R /absolute/path/to/my-plugin ./plugins/my-plugin

Step 2: Add or update $REPO_ROOT/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json so that source.path points to that plugin directory with a ./-prefixed relative path:

{
  "name": "local-repo",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "my-plugin",
      "source": {
        "source": "local",
        "path": "./plugins/my-plugin"
      },
      "policy": {
        "installation": "AVAILABLE",
        "authentication": "ON_INSTALL"
      },
      "category": "Productivity"
    }
  ]
}

Step 3: Restart Codex and verify that the plugin appears.

The marketplace file points to the plugin location, so those directories are examples rather than fixed requirements. Codex resolves source.path relative to the marketplace root, not relative to the .agents/plugins/ folder. See Marketplace metadata for the file format.

After you change the plugin, update the plugin directory that your marketplace entry points to and restart Codex so the local install picks up the new files.

Marketplace metadata

If you maintain a repo marketplace, define it in $REPO_ROOT/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json. For a personal marketplace, use ~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json. A marketplace file controls plugin ordering and install policies in Codex-facing catalogs. It can represent one plugin while you are testing or a curated list of plugins that you want Codex to show together under one marketplace name. Before you add a plugin to a marketplace, make sure its version, publisher metadata, and install-surface copy are ready for other developers to see.

{
  "name": "local-example-plugins",
  "interface": {
    "displayName": "Local Example Plugins"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "my-plugin",
      "source": {
        "source": "local",
        "path": "./plugins/my-plugin"
      },
      "policy": {
        "installation": "AVAILABLE",
        "authentication": "ON_INSTALL"
      },
      "category": "Productivity"
    },
    {
      "name": "research-helper",
      "source": {
        "source": "local",
        "path": "./plugins/research-helper"
      },
      "policy": {
        "installation": "AVAILABLE",
        "authentication": "ON_INSTALL"
      },
      "category": "Productivity"
    }
  ]
}

Use top-level name to identify the marketplace.
Use interface.displayName for the marketplace title shown in Codex.
Add one object per plugin under plugins to build a curated list that Codex shows under that marketplace title.
Point each plugin entry’s source.path at the plugin directory you want Codex to load. For repo installs, that often lives under ./plugins/. For personal installs, a common pattern is ./.codex/plugins/<plugin-name>.
Keep source.path relative to the marketplace root, start it with ./, and keep it inside that root.
Always include policy.installation, policy.authentication, and category on each plugin entry.
Use policy.installation values such as AVAILABLE, INSTALLED_BY_DEFAULT, or NOT_AVAILABLE.
Use policy.authentication to decide whether auth happens on install or first use.
The marketplace controls where Codex loads the plugin from. source.path can point somewhere else if your plugin lives outside those example directories. A marketplace file can live in the repo where you are developing the plugin or in a separate marketplace repo, and one marketplace file can point to one plugin or many.

How Codex uses marketplaces

A plugin marketplace is a JSON catalog of plugins that Codex can read and install.

Codex can read marketplace files from:

the curated marketplace that powers the official Plugin Directory
a repo marketplace at $REPO_ROOT/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json
a personal marketplace at ~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json
You can install any plugin exposed through a marketplace. Codex installs plugins into ~/.codex/plugins/cache/$MARKETPLACE_NAME/$PLUGIN_NAME/$VERSION/. For local plugins, $VERSION is local, and Codex loads the installed copy from that cache path rather than directly from the marketplace entry.

You can enable or disable each plugin individually. Codex stores each plugin’s on or off state in ~/.codex/config.toml.

Package and distribute plugins

Plugin structure

Every plugin has a manifest at .codex-plugin/plugin.json. It can also include a skills/ directory, an .app.json file that points at one or more apps or connectors, and assets used to present the plugin across supported surfaces.

my-plugin/
.codex-plugin/
plugin.json
Required: plugin manifest
skills/
my-skill/
SKILL.md
Optional: skill instructions
.app.json
Optional: app or connector mappings
.mcp.json
Optional: MCP server configuration
assets/
Optional: icons, logos, screenshots
Only plugin.json belongs in .codex-plugin/. Keep skills/, assets/, .mcp.json, and .app.json at the plugin root.

Published plugins typically use a richer manifest than the minimal example that appears in quick-start scaffolds. The manifest has three jobs:

Identify the plugin.
Point to bundled components such as skills, apps, or MCP servers.
Provide install-surface metadata such as descriptions, icons, and legal links.
Here’s a complete manifest example:

{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Bundle reusable skills and app integrations.",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your team",
    "email": "team@example.com",
    "url": "https://example.com"
  },
  "homepage": "https://example.com/plugins/my-plugin",
  "repository": "https://github.com/example/my-plugin",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["research", "crm"],
  "skills": "./skills/",
  "mcpServers": "./.mcp.json",
  "apps": "./.app.json",
  "interface": {
    "displayName": "My Plugin",
    "shortDescription": "Reusable skills and apps",
    "longDescription": "Distribute skills and app integrations together.",
    "developerName": "Your team",
    "category": "Productivity",
    "capabilities": ["Read", "Write"],
    "websiteURL": "https://example.com",
    "privacyPolicyURL": "https://example.com/privacy",
    "termsOfServiceURL": "https://example.com/terms",
    "defaultPrompt": [
      "Use My Plugin to summarize new CRM notes.",
      "Use My Plugin to triage new customer follow-ups."
    ],
    "brandColor": "#10A37F",
    "composerIcon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "logo": "./assets/logo.png",
    "screenshots": ["./assets/screenshot-1.png"]
  }
}

.codex-plugin/plugin.json is the required entry point. The other manifest fields are optional, but published plugins commonly use them.

Manifest fields

Use the top-level fields to define package metadata and point to bundled components:

name, version, and description identify the plugin.
author, homepage, repository, license, and keywords provide publisher and discovery metadata.
skills, mcpServers, and apps point to bundled components relative to the plugin root.
interface controls how install surfaces present the plugin.
Use the interface object for install-surface metadata:

displayName, shortDescription, and longDescription control the title and descriptive copy.
developerName, category, and capabilities add publisher and capability metadata.
websiteURL, privacyPolicyURL, and termsOfServiceURL provide external links.
defaultPrompt, brandColor, composerIcon, logo, and screenshots control starter prompts and visual presentation.
Path rules

Keep manifest paths relative to the plugin root and start them with ./.
Store visual assets such as composerIcon, logo, and screenshots under ./assets/ when possible.
Use skills for bundled skill folders, apps for .app.json, and mcpServers for .mcp.json.
Publish official public plugins
